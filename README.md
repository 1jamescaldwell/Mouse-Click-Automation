A python script I wrote for automating mouse clicks. This Python script automates the process of adjusting mouse settings in Logitech's Logi+ Options application. It uses the pyautogui library to simulate mouse clicks and scrolls, and the pygetwindow library to bring the Logi+ Options window to the foreground. In the future, I would like to further develop this code to "learn" clicks then automatically run whenever called. As is, the click positions are hard-coded for my computer.
